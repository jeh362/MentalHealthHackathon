**Little Victories**

Our Little Victories app allows users to record short entries of their daily wins. This could be as small as taking a step outside to making your bed or something as big as completing a long-term project. Users can choose to attach a photo that relates to their victory that gets saved to their entry. Users will be able to look back on their entries and view the attached photos with a simple tap on desired victory as well as edit their entries. Usersâ€™ profile page will display the number of entries they have as well as display a motivational quote. The profile page will also display a question that allows users to opt into monthly reminders by entering their phone number.
