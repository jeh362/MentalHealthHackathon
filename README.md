**Little Victories**

Our Little Victories app allows users to record short entries of their daily wins. This could be as small as taking a step outside to making your bed or something as big as completing a long-term project. Users can choose to attach a photo that relates to their victory that gets saved to their entry. Users will be able to look back on their entries and view the attached photos with a simple tap on desired victory as well as edit their entries. Users’ profile page will display the number of entries they have as well as display a motivational quote. The profile page will also display a question that allows users to opt into monthly reminders by entering their phone number.

**Inspiration**

We wanted to create something related to the theme of mental health that was simple, quick, and evoked positivity. That was when we thought of our lives as university students. Having just completed our first year at university, we realized that we tended to get caught up in the whirlwind of trying to balance our academic and social life that we neglected our mental health at times. We figured that this is probably the case for many people in all stages of life, albeit under different circumstances. As our responsibilities and aspirations grow (or as life passes in general), it is important to remind ourselves to celebrate even the little things in life. Celebrating the small things can help one practice positivity and gratitude which can help to reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. And that’s why we decided to build Little Victories. To help people highlight the positive aspects of their life no matter how small they may be.
